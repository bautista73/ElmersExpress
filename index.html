                            <p>Elmer's Express Delivery went above and beyond my expectations. Elmer was very upfront about costs, provided a contract, estimate, and invoice, and answered any questions I had.

I live in Seattle and while I believe this company is based closer to Woodinville and Monroe, they have just as good - if not better - prices. This is the first time I've ever used a moving service, and it was a great experience. Recommend!</p>

                          <p>I ordered a brand new dining table and the furniture company utilized Elmer for white-glove delivery services. Elmer was communicative throughout the delivery process. Elmer's team showed up as scheduled. My dining table was delivered and installed perfectly. Very professional staff who took extra-precaution inside the house when putting together table. Having utilized moving services in the past, Elmer's is top-notch and I only wish I had known about their services sooner!</p>
