                    <p>I needed to move a storage unit with antique furniture and fragile collectables to my new residence. Elmer made my move easy and stress free.  He was knowledgeable, kind and professional from start to finish and made sure everything went smoothly. His estimate was spot on and very very fair---the cost was lower than what I expected too. His team, Louis and Marina, did an amazing job as well. Very nice people, reliable and professional. Treated my belongings with care. I highly recommend Elmer for your moving needs.  I will most definitely use his company again for future moves.</p>
